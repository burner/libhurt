Custom std library for D2. I'm writing a lexer generator for D2.  Every time I
normally would use a function of Phobos I create it myself.

The license is GPL.

Features:
	Container:
		Bitmap
		Double Linked List

		// Map MultiMap and Set can use BinarySeachTrees, RBTrees as well as
		// HashMaps as underlying datastructures, simple by passing an argument
		// to there constructors
		Map
		MultiMap
		Set
		MapSet (looks like Map!(T,Set!(S)) )

		Single Linked List
		Double Linked List
		Stack
		Vector
		Deque ( Double ended random acces Vector )

	Convert:
		Numbertypes to string
		string to Numbertypes
		utfX to utfX (x = (8,16,32)
		Numbertypes to Numbertypes (sort of a safe cast)
	
	io:
		ported std.stream from phobos
		C File like File
		print(f)(ln) sort of

	Util:
		time modules from tango
		append to array functions
		find in array functions
		sort function

	String:
		StringBuffer(T) (T = (char,wchar,dchar))
		lower, upper
		printf style format 

	Math:
		BigInteger (needed this for some Euler Projects)
		Min, Max, Abs
